# functional-programming

## Introduction ✌️
For this project we're fetching data from the oba (public library of Amsterdam) api and creating a research case. With the data we're going to make visualizations with d3.js (which I have never used before). Main point of the project is this README. This README contains the research questions, sub-questions, hypotheses and code (screenshots).

## Process 📝

### Research Questions 🔍
- Is there a connection between the publication-date and the thickness of books? (Were thicker books more popular?
- Is there a connection between the size of a book and the publication-date? (Were bigger books more popular?
- Does the publication-date have a connection with the length of the titles? (Were titles back in the day longer?
- Were there trends in subjects/genres per year?
- 👉**How long are books borrowed on average per year?**
- Did books get more popular or not, (or) did movies get more populair to borrow??
- 👉**Are certain genres returned too late more often than others?**
- 👉**Which genres have have emerged since 1950?**

  #### Picked Questions 📍
- How long are books borrowed on average per year?
  - **v.2** How long are books from certain genres borrowed per year on average?
- Are certain genres returned too late more often than others?
- Which genres have have emerged since 1950?
  - **v.2** How has the popularity changed of certain genres since 1950?
  - **v.3** Which genres are there from the year 2000?
### Sub-Questions 👶
- Do certain changes in popularity of a genre have a connection with an event/happening from that year?
- Can the popularity of genres be categorised by province?
- Can the popularity of genres be categorised by gender?

### Hypotheses 🤓
-


### What data do I need?
- Genres => Name, amount
- Publication year
- (Location(s) of the books)
